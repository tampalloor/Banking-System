# Banking-System
Input:
To test the program a file will be passed in by argument to the program on the
command line. The file will contain a list of transactions that need to be executed.
Transactions of the format described below (see section on transactions) will be contained in
this file. There will be one transaction per line.

That said, there may be errors in the transactions themselves. For instance, a transaction may
try to withdraw more money than there is a fund or try to withdraw for a non-existent fund.
See the section below entitled errors for details.

Client Accounts and Funds:
Each client account contains assets held in up to eight funds. A client account is
represented by a first and last name (two strings) and a unique id (integer).
The eight funds that each account have are as follows:

  0: Money Market 5: Capital Value Fund
  1: Prime Money Market 6: Growth Equity Fund
  2: Long-Term Bond 7: Growth Index Fund
  3: Short-Term Bond
  4: 500 Index Fund
  
All client accounts are opened with an open transaction, O (see below).

Transactions:
  There are five types of transactions and each are identified by a character beginning the line.
  
  O: Open a client account and instantiate eight funds with 0 assets each
  D: Deposit assets into a fund
  W: Withdraw assets from a fund
  T: Transfer assets between funds (can be funds owned by a single client or
  transfers between clients)
  A: Display the history of all transactions for a client account
  F: Display the history for all transactions of a given fund
  
  The format for the commands consists of a transaction type (above), followed by an account id,
  fund id, and amount. For transfers the from account and fund comes before to account and
  fund.
  
Examples:

  D 1234 1 100     Deposit $100 into the prime money market account of client ID 1234
  W 1234 0 500     Withdraw $500 from the money market of client ID 1234.
  T 1234 0 1234 1 1000     Transfer $1000 from client 1234's money market to the prime money market.
  T 1234 0 5678 0 1000     Transfer $1000 from 1234's money market to 5678's money market.
  A 1234     Display the history of all transactions of all accounts for client 1234.
  F 1234 4     Display the history for all transactions on the 500 Index Fund for client 1234
  O 6537 Bowden Charles     Open an account for client Charles Bowden. Use account id 6537.
Errors:

  As noted above, assume the format (number and types of input items) are correct. However,
  the program deals with all other types semantic errors. For instance, there could be a
  bad account number (for instance, one already used) or an amount which is too much to
  withdraw. Also, assume that each line will begin with an appropriate letter: O, W, D, T, A, and
  F.

Examples of errors which may occur:

  W 6543 6 10000 (when the Gowth Equity fund of client 6543 has only $20)
  D 7654 76 1000
  A transaction that would cause a balance to become negative should not occur and is an error
  (A withdrawal or transfer of $0 is fine). There is one exception to this rule: if you are
  withdrawing from a money market fund with insufficient dollars, and it can be covered with
  dollars from the other money market fund owned by the client account, the desired amount
  (only the partial amount needed to cover the withdrawal) is moved to that money market
  account. The two Bond accounts are handled similarly. If one is transferring between two
  linked funds (say, 0 and 1) then the transaction should only succeed if the fund being
  withdrawn from has enough funds. No other types of accounts are handled in this manner.
  Appropriate error messages should be printed out to cerr. No other messages should be
  printed out during phase 1 or phase 2.
  
Output:

  In Phase 3, each client account will be printed out with the amount held in each
  account. Please make sure to create an intuitive and readable output for this aspect of the
  program. This should be part of the design.
  
Data Structures:

  One key aspect of this Lab exercise is the right class design for handling the problem. So
  in general there is no pre-defined classes or signature structure for the classes required. The
  suggestion is to keep the balances as ints (doubles or floats are not required). This is up to you
  to define. However, there are two data structures which are required.
  First, you need to use a queue to read the transactions into during phase 1. All
  transactions should be read before processing starts. The queue can be the STL queue.
  Second, the client accounts should be stored in a binary search tree (BSTree). Please
  note that for the design phase of the assignment you can assume the BSTree is just a container
  with functions like Retrieve, Insert, and Empty.
